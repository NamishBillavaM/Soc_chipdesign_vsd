### PACKAGE

![ARDUINOLEONARDO](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cc18b24-b063-49dc-801e-37b23f1a02b5)

- The **_PACKAGE_** of the chip which is a protective layer or packet bound over the actual chip and the actual manufatured chip is usually present at the center of a package.
- The connections from package is fed to the chip by WIRE BOUND method which is none other than basic wired connection.

### CHIP
![DAY11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40997a27-3077-4344-be31-955efa96e0d4)


- Inside the chip, all the signals from the external world to the chip and vice versa is passed through **_PADS_**.
- The area bound by the pads is **_CORE_** where all the digital logic of the chip is placed.
- Both the core and pads make up the **_DIE_** which is the basic manufacturing unit in the semiconductor chips.

### FOUNDRY
- **_Foundry_** is the place where the semiconductor chips are manufactured and FOUNDRY IP's are Intellectual Properties based on a specific foundry and these IP's require a specific level of intelligence to be produced.

### MACROS
- Digital logic blocks in the CHIP are called **_MACROS_**.
